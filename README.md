# about_me
Bio 
I am a student of life, learning and growing on the daily, having an open mind is critical when it comes to coding and programming. Currently learning about VS Code, conda, version controls, functional programming, test driven development and so much more!! Applying what I learn and asking for help is my mantra :)
